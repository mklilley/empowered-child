This is a Montessori inspired project. My youngest child loves this the most. She has spent the
past three years matching and naming the felt continents, placing our toy animals on each and 
singing a Continent Song; I would put a link but I haven't been able to find the song online, it 
was one that was once sang to my eldest daughter and it stuck.

You can use cards instead, if you don't have toy animals and as you can see mine like to use both.


> This project was inspired by Stephaine at ImagineOurLife.com
She has some amazing projects. I had never crafted or sewed before and I enjoyed making this map.

I have been collecting Schleich animals https://www.schleich-s.com/en/GB/wild-life.html over the years
but if you wanted to start your collection off quickly, then Toobs are great place to start. The Wild 
TOOB, is only missing a penguin to be complete.
