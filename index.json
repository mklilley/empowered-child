[{"categories":["home projects"],"contents":"Happy New Year!\nThe children happily made paper lanterns for days.\nMy eldest attended a library session and bought back a New Year Dragon.\nI made a more complicated lantern. It looks lovely and I had fun but it was more time consuming.\n Books \u0026lsquo;The Great Race\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Panda\u0026rsquo;.\n ![](../images/posts/Book_and_year_of_the_pig (1).JPG)\nThe pigs are from my Schleich collection.\nI used pompoms, left over from Christmas, for fruit and left them to be placed onto my drawing of a willow tree.\nFor an extra challenge I left chopsticks. My eldest is loves using chopsticks and my youngest was willing to give it a go. Partially helped by this great game Totem Zen. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to get hold of now but this is one of my favourite Djeco games. I\u0026rsquo;m sure you could make your own but the matching cards are great and you can play this as a one player game, tackling each difficulty level at time or selecting at random.\n","permalink":"https://empoweredchild.co.uk/chinese-new-year/","tags":["home educating"],"title":"Chinese New Year 2020"},{"categories":["home projects"],"contents":"This is a Montessori inspired project. My youngest child loves this the most. She has spent the past three years matching and naming the felt continents, placing our toy animals on each and singing a Continent Song; I would put a link but I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to find the song online, it was one that was once sang to my eldest daughter and it stuck.\nYou can use cards instead, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have toy animals and as you can see mine like to use both.\n This project was inspired by Stephaine at ImagineOurLife.com She has some amazing projects. I had never crafted or sewed before and I enjoyed making this map.\n I have been collecting Schleich animals over the years but if you wanted to start your collection off quickly, then Toobs are great place to start. The Wild TOOB, is only missing a penguin to be complete.\n","permalink":"https://empoweredchild.co.uk/continents/","tags":["home educating"],"title":"Continents"},{"categories":["nature"],"contents":"Having fun in nature.\n","permalink":"https://empoweredchild.co.uk/we-love-trees/","tags":["family","trees","outside"],"title":"We love trees!"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Here\u0026rsquo;s me more than a decade ago. Before I was a mum of two. Before I had assimilated the usual suspects from the patenting section of my bookshop and found something wanting. Before I moved my bed to the floor, and put my one year old\u0026rsquo;s next to it. Before I formed an amazing friendship with an amazing woman, who then introduced me to some more amazing women who had come before her. Before I home-schooled.
